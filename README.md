# Arma-3-Controlled-Spawn-and-Waypoints-Randomizr

**Faction Spawns:**
Manually define which marks the faction can use as a spawn point. You can create unlimited spawn points for one or more factions. Once the spawn points are created, the script will spawn the groups randomly through the faction spawns.

**Destination:**
Manually define which marks will be used as waypoints. There are 2 types of destinations: those that can be visited by everyone; and those that only a specific faction can go to. Once the destinations are created, the script will take care of taking (or not) the groups there, randomly.

**Moving:**
There are 3 types of group movement: groups that go randomly and only to their faction's destinations; groups that go randomly and only to destinations shared with other factions; and groups that go randomly to any configured destination, ignoring rules.

**Groups:**
Manually set the number of soldiers and vehicles per faction group type. There are 3 infantry and 3 vehicle templates for you to customize:	light squad; normal squad; heavy squad; light vehicle; normal vehicle; and heavy vehicle. There is no re-spawn. Death is death. 

**Strategy:**
Manually define how many groups, what type of groups, and how the random moves of each group in the faction will be.
