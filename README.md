# Arma 3: Controlled Spawn & Waypoints Randomizr v1.2.1
>*Dependencies: none.*

A simple and controlled spawn and waypoints solution where groups of units and vehicles will be randomized through marks in your mission. 

**Faction Spawns:** 
- Manually define which marks the faction can use as a spawn point.
- You can create a lot of spawn points for one or more factions.
- Once the spawn points are created, the script will spawn the groups randomly through the faction spawns.
- There is no re-spawn. Death is death. 

**Destination:**
- Manually define which marks will be used as group destinations.
- You can create unlimited destination points for one or more factions.
- Once the destination points are created, the script will consider (or not) them randomly when the groups are moving.
- There are 2 types of destinations: those that can be visited by everyone; and those that only a specific faction can go to.

**Destination / Waypoints:**
- Manually define which marks will be used as waypoints.
- There are 2 types of destinations: those that can be visited by everyone; and those that only a specific faction can go to.
- Once the destinations are created, the script will take care of taking (or not) the groups there, randomly.

**Group Members:**
- Manually set the number of soldiers, who they are, who belongs in each squad, even vehicles.
- There are 3 infantry and 3 vehicle templates to customize: light squad; regular squad; heavy squad; light vehicle; regular vehicle; and heavy vehicle. 

**Strategy:**
- Manually define how many groups, what type of groups, if they will spawn chill or already aware, running etc.
- It does important you as editor set the movements through the field each group can consider randomly.
